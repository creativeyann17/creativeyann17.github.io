# Introduction

Hello, this repository contains the source-code of my web-site [creativeyann17.github.io](https://creativeyann17.github.io/). The purpose of this web-site is to showcase some of my acquired skills and knowledge in web and software development. The following readme gives some details about of the choices done to develop it.

# Technologies

This project is built on the following stack:

| Technology                | Type                   | Reason of the choice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GitHub                    | Repository             | Most of my others projects are located here, it's free and provide a lot of features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| GitHub Pages              | Server                 | At first I didn't know it was a thing! But the fact that it's well integrated, easy to use and free made me choose it instead of another provider.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| GitHub Actions            | Continuous integration | At first I was using a React third party library named [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) to build and deploy in local, it worked really well, until I was in need of a real CI to define env. variables and secrets.                                                                                                                           |
| React.js                  | Library                | Since I learned it for my first employment after arriving at Montreal it's difficult to imagine working with another user interfaces builder. Some really well known libraries are used too: react-router, react-redux, react-saga, react-bootstrap, prop-types, lodash, typescript and more ...                                                             |
| Bootstrap                 | Library (UI/UX)        | Developing is already time consuming so I was in need of a library with a lot of components responsive-ready and some CSS helpers. I chose bootstrap because I worked with before. The react library [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/).                                                                                                |
| Markdown                  | Styling                | One of the web-site feature is to provide a list of articles the user can read, like tutorials ... In order to avoid writing everything inside the code itself the idea is to write independent markdown files that will be retrieved from the server. The react library used to read markdown [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown). |
| Google Analytics          | Analytics              | Always nice to have some information about the visitors like the devices they used, from which country, what pages they look the most ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| creativeyann17-github-api | API                    | A **Micronaut API** deployed on **Heroku** to expand the possibilities of the web-site. You can find the current source-code [here](https://github.com/creativeyann17/creativeyann17-github-api).                                                                                                                                                            |
| Websocket                 | API Feature            | Using **creativeyann17-github-api** the web-site will connect (and retry if necessary) to the API. Online users can be notified in realtime of changes using this feature.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Article count of views    | API Feature            | When reading an article the web-site will **increase by one** (if never read before) or **get** the count of views of the article. Every others viewers will be notified by **websocket** of the change in **realtime**. The web-site will remember in local if the article has been read before or not.                                                     |
| GraphQL                   | Query                  | Proof of concept of using GraphQL on both API + front-end. Currently implemented within **redux/saga** service because of difficulties to use @Apollo/Client hooks to make it work as expected. An **environment variable** is used to switch between REST/GraphQL.                                                                                          |
| Article likes             | API Feature            | Users have now the ability **to like an article**. Same as count of views, this feature uses **websocket** to be notified if another user liked the article too. Users can't like the same article twice and this state is saved in **local storage** (nothing on the server side).                                                                          |
